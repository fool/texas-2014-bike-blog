                    <p>i like my alone time, but i really lucked out in finding david.  he&rsquo;s an almost-done food science major at my parents&rsquo; university, taking a semester off to ride around the country - san jose-&gt;LA-&gt;latched onto the southern tier-&gt;up the east coast-&gt;back to illinois, so his youthful vigor is a nice offset to my occasional whiny old-man-ness (it&rsquo;s chafing!  i&rsquo;m tired.  i&rsquo;ll just get a hotel here.)  today we climbed over a mile, descended the same, and in general had a great time.  tonight we camp on a lakeside (caballo lake), tomorrow we stay with Ted (Ted is not yet aware he&rsquo;ll have two couch surfers), and sunday in el paso we have a bike-friendly home to crash at as well, so all of our ducks are in a row for the next few days, which is always nice to know.  How quickly I turns to we when we both find the happiness of fellow travelers; David&rsquo;s thinking he&rsquo;ll stick with me til austin, and i hope i can keep up - he tends to leave early, finish late, and go hard and long without necessarily having a stopping-spot plan, all of which is a bit different than me, but probably more functional than my style in a lot of ways.<br/><br/>this morning we set off probably as early as i ever have - we were eating at 730 (free passable breakfast at the hotel - David&rsquo;s not super budget-travellin&rsquo;, but he does appreciate the &ldquo;free calories&rdquo; and the cheaper stays.  the less i spend on the road, the more rounds of drinks i can buy my friends in austin, eh?), rolling at 8.  saw some bona fide bike commuters coming into and out of silver city - probably the first time i&rsquo;ve seen more than a single since san diego.  we turned pretty quickly onto a small road that went nowhere anyone else woudl want to go, really, except an about to be end-of-lifed copper mine, which had a &ldquo;scenic overlook&rdquo; with the same kind of propaganda we ran into in waihi town around the gold mine about what a help the mine is to the community and we&rsquo;re totally fixing the tiniest part of our pollution any day now, yay!<br/><br/>but we got a cute picture that&hellip;er.. you&rsquo;ll see later.<br/><br/>we took that road (NM 152) from beginning to end today, and in the middle of it we went from 5700&rsquo; to 8200&rsquo; elevation, with enough ups and downs getting there and back to take us up and down the vertical mile, and survey says:<br/><br/>the climbometer - slow and steady and quantity like crazy!  but it was low traffic, gorgeous quantity, in the last we&rsquo;ll see of the gila national forest, &ldquo;land of many uses&rdquo; though we saw none, other than &ldquo;hey that&rsquo;s pretty!&rdquo;<br/><br/>the descendophone - screamed for approximately 30 straight miles off of the pass.  it was great to descend so far - david didn&rsquo;t pedal for 5+ miles (i got impatient when our speed dropped below 20), and to have a bit of a tailwind to help push us along the slightly slower parts.  and to get to use the big gears for awhile to pedal - my granny gear has seen more use this trip than&hellip;ever, but my high gears almost none.  so i pedalled along at 25,30,35mph today just for grins.  and i grinned a lot :)<br/><br/>the flatoscope - nearly unused.<br/><br/>we ended at a state park by a lakeside, to the strains of another fabulous sunset following some excellent shower-age, and David just started a fire with flint and steel so we&rsquo;ll have something to eat around.  and eating was good, watching the stars was good, and we made friends with the folks camping next to us, and chatted amongst ourselves for awhile.<br/><br/>since he&rsquo;s got a camera and more of an urge for this - there&rsquo;ll more pictures than usual, coming soon :)</p>
