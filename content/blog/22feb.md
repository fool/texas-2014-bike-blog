this post is a procrastination technique!  I should really be rolling and will in a few minutes, out of phoenix and into the high desert.  before i've just been in the low desert, mostly :)  the next week and a half or so will be the most punishing bit - some days without any access to water, at least a couple of 4000' climb days, etc.  but also according to emily some beautiful country, so i'm looking forward to it to.  the next real pit stop is el paso - which means i'll be leaving arizona in a few days, and then leaving new mexico in just over a week.  the miles fly by, the days will be cooler (since i'll be higher, but also CA/AZ are hotter now than NM/TX, according to Ray, the other-direction cyclist i met a couple days ago who suffered through texas freezage.</p>
<p>during my off day yesterday i:</p>
<p>1) went to the bike shop (this guy was great to me and conveniently located blocks off the route through town and from my hotel: <a href="http://www.trymebicycles.com/">http://www.trymebicycles.com/</a>) and got chain lube since i was squeaky.  also invested in some presta-&gt;schraeder valve converters so i can use gas station air pumps on my tires (my little hand pump is pitiful and hard to get &gt;50psi out of)</p>
<p>2) got a great massage so while i'm still sore, i think it's a more productive soreness?</p>
<p>3) fixed a rub from my fender, and upon reassembling my bike, the shifting had stopped working.  discovered in a panic at 5pm, i was prepared to delay departure another day and cursed myself for not finding out earlier.  about to call velocult in desperation for hopes of advice by phone, i took a closer look and discovered i'd pinched the shifter cable housing in the wheel skewer.  thankfully, fixed :)</p>
<p>4) did not sleep like a baby last night (did the night before tho).  not enough exercise i guess.  i'll fix that today :)</p>
<p>tonight's goal: superior (town of). </p>
