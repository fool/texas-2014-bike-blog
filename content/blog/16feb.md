Not much happened yesterday on the short ride into Brawley - there were more people in the desert playing on their ATV's, sand rails, jeeps, and dune buggies than lived in Ocotillo, and the entire town of "Plaster City" consists of a freaking huge plaster mill (no houses.  Biggest solar array I've ever seen...at the plant though!).  Today I have a long, serviceless ride into Palo Verde, but am packing extra food and water.
