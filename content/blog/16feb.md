Not much happened yesterday on the short ride into Brawley - there were more people in the desert playing on their ATV&rsquo;s, sand rails, jeeps, and dune buggies than lived in ocotillo, and the entire town of &ldquo;plaster city&rdquo; consists of a freaking huge plaster mill (no houses.  biggest solar array i&rsquo;ve ever seen, at the plant tho!).  Today I have a long, serviceless ride into Palo Verde, but am packing extra food and water.   I don&rsquo;t expect cell service tonight so no post til tomorrow or the next day.  miss you all!</p>
