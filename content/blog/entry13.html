                                    <h1>chatting and flatting</h1>
                    <p>once deb and john got home, conversation ran until it was bedtime.  deb&rsquo;s a musician &amp; jill of many trades, some technical, and john&rsquo;s got a phd in astronomy but also a history of doing IT work for a living.  john did most of the talking and is a fascinating fellow with an interest in just about anything technical - computers to chemistry to geology to physics.  conversation ranged from parallel computing to telescope repair to chemistry; meanwhile i bonded with their menagerie (5 cats and 2 dogs). and it was great!<br/><br/>john had hoped to take me on a telescope tour in the morning, so i said sure and up we went around 9.  those huge telescopes are fascinating inside and incredibly massive  - like, 190 tons and 4 stories tall!  since the view from up there is fabulous, he also gave me a little geography/geology tour of the area, and it has far more going on than is obvious, though most of it isn&rsquo;t something i can easily retell, it was quite interesting.  so then it&rsquo;s 2 hours later &amp; i&rsquo;m back at their place, getting my bike put together and finally ready to roll around noon.  my front rack isn&rsquo;t really attached properly at this point, but i think it&rsquo;ll do - i rerouted the brake cable so it goes over the attachment (which had bent downwards onto the cable) and from my testing it seems to work ok, so i&rsquo;m as set as i&rsquo;m gonna be outside of some fairly laborious disassembly, jury-rigging, and reassembly.  spoiler:  rack seemed to work fine for the day :)<br/><br/>john said it&rsquo;s a screaming downhill to the town of ft davis (~12 miles) and so it was, with just enough uphills in to make me wish i&rsquo;d eaten breakfast, but i roll up to the first cafe without incident, my front tire finally holding air steadily, and munch down on some chinese food that&rsquo;s surprisingly decent for an empty cafe in nowheresville.  (unfortunately, i give the cafe about a month before they go out of business&hellip;) coming out of the cafe, disappointed to realize that the ice cream shop next door is only open fri-sun, so no blue bell for me!  then getting back on my bike, i find it has a rear flat, and unfortunately, i&rsquo;ve broken the last of my tire levers getting my front tire back on the bike after the last flat, so i seem to be outta luck&hellip;can&rsquo;t change the tire.  fortunately my map says that a bed and breakfast in town has bike tools (next bike shop: 24 miles away and rarely open, says the scuttlebutt), so i wrote part 1 of this post at the b&amp;b awaiting the return of the proprietor from a bike ride so i can borrow (and hopefully buy one of) his tire levers, to make it to the next town over, alpine, tonight.  i was hoping to get as far as marathon today (~65 miles - but nearly entirely downhill.  actually all the way to del rio is pretty much downhill, from here), but it&rsquo;s too late in the day for going that far (still 50ish miles) now at 2pm, plus, my legs are still screaming from yesterday, as i discovered/was reminded on each and every hill.  a short day today will be useful, since it&rsquo;s gonna be followed by a few more longish (but not epic-long like yesterday) days into del rio.<br/><br/>while sitting in the yard of this b&amp;b, a few friends text - lori cheers me up, i cheer rachel on in pursuit of a job on my team back at the office, and david lets me know that he is getting a ride to austin since he is far too sick to keep riding.  This is good and bad: the equipment failure, and loss of riding companion david is pretty frustrating.  but as i talk with some locals, and sit and think, i remember that i&rsquo;m only doing this to have fun, and when the fun stops, i can stop.  in the next town over is amtrak.  in 4 days is a town that also has amtrak - and is big enough to rent a car in, in case i want to throw the bike in and drive (hitchhiking is a fine option between towns, but i&rsquo;m unlikely to find a simple ride from Del Rio to Austin - it&rsquo;s not as though it&rsquo;s a straight shot down one road). I&rsquo;m definitely ready to have more around-town kinda riding, carrying less stuff.  fortunately, i never had the completionist goal, and wherever i stop, well, i can pick up there again some later year, perhaps.<br/><br/>once the tool-owner returns, he graciously gives me a tire lever, i get the tube changed, and with his blessing that i&rsquo;ll have no trouble making it down the road before dark, i set off - i have a little over 2 hours, 24 miles - which is my average pace, barring flats or ice cream shops.  as soon as i&rsquo;m back in the saddle, i remember that i enjoy biking, pedal hard, see some more great scenery (hoodoos!  a ranch owned by the family of some kids i went to high school with!  a javalina trying to get through a wire fence!) and make good time twisting out of the hills.  and then i get to the &ldquo;flat part&rdquo; which is flat like pancake.  and devoid of anything to help keep the wind off me.  so, i struggle in the headwind for another hour.  but then i get to town and it&rsquo;s great:  accidentally find the cheapest hotel (the guy with the tools warned me to avoid the RV park i was angling for), get some dinner in me, chat with Lori on the phone for awhile, and my spirits are up high enough to keep me in the saddle for the time being.<br/><br/>today, marathon, then 3 normal-length days to del rio, where i can figure out what comes next.</p>
