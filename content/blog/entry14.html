                    <p>alpine to marathon<br/><br/>it was going to be an epic-short post:  got on bike.  turned left out of hotel parking lot.  2 hours + 31 miles later, pulled up to marathon post office - without leaving saddle or highway 90.<br/><br/>that much is true, but some other stuff went down after arrival but before i could write:<br/><br/>while looking for supposed bike-friendly hostel where i thought i&rsquo;d mapped it out to, i wiped out on a patch of gravel.  pretty well bounced back up, and didn&rsquo;t even hit the ground since the bike fell onto panniers rather than flesh.  dusted off and no damage done.  couldn&rsquo;t find hostel to save my life, so headed back into town, now that post office was open again after lunch, to buy postcard stamps.  mission accomplished!  had a recovery rootbeer float for though this 31 miles was the easiest of the trip so far - must have been kinda downhill since averaging &gt;15mph for 2 hours is not normal for me, and it was a bit windy and there were a few minor hills, both of which slowed me down to 9-10mph for brief stretches.  found sign for hostel, realized i was on the wrong side of the tracks (literally).  rode up the other side of town, found the hostel, which is pretty DIY but beautiful in many ways.  i&rsquo;ll take a good photo set for later postage.  met 3 other touring riders (going the other way), there, and the caretaker and proprietor.  we&rsquo;ve been promised evening whiskey+campfire, and i&rsquo;m eager to actually drink some of this whiskey i&rsquo;ve been lugging.  still hasn&rsquo;t appealed while all alone, to be honest.  wrote some postcards, drank a couple beers at the white buffalo tavern (yeah, there&rsquo;s a huge stuffed albino buffalo up there on the wall), and as soon as i can post, will head back to be social with the folks back at the hostel.<br/><br/>next 3 days will be pretty easy riding but 3 ~60 mile days with little in the way of services, so i&rsquo;ll hopefully be using up this heavy, huge cache of food i&rsquo;ve been carrying forever.  may not find internet so don&rsquo;t be too worried if the whole blog-posting thing doesn&rsquo;t happen, or our online scrabble/boggle games time out.<br/><br/>now for pictures!<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="421" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/101ac46512a95133ffe11f3ffa7209f6/tumblr_inline_n238d6q21e1suf445.jpg"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/438bbf4f2fe3120aa21c3f4a15140093/tumblr_inline_pjzp58BVEL1suf445_540.jpg" data-orig-height="421" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/101ac46512a95133ffe11f3ffa7209f6/tumblr_inline_n238d6q21e1suf445.jpg"/></figure></p>
