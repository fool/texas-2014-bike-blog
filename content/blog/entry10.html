                                    <h1>kinda bummer day</h1>
                    <p>Such a sweet, friendly send-off from the Bachs (our warmshowers/couchsurfing hosts in el paso), complete with breakfast, hugs, hopes of future visits, etc, went south quickly.  credit unions that wouldn&rsquo;t accept deposits for me meaning i won&rsquo;t get the rent checks in the bank until long after the mortgage payment clears (is not deadly, just annoying), followed by David getting really sick and having to stop riding while still in town.  since it was still before lunch and he knows i&rsquo;m a bit hurried towards austin, he suggested i go on and he&rsquo;d catch up on a later day.  hopefully sooner rather than later, but we&rsquo;re talking a lot of long days over the next week into el rio and his company &amp; encouragement will be sorely missed.  once i was sure he was gonna be able to find a place to crash tonight, i rolled out</p>
<p>with heavy heart i got back on the trafficky street, whose shoulder promptly disappeared, but unfortunately the traffic remained really heavy and a headwind picked up.  the traffic petered out after 15 miles (no close calls), but the headwind stayed with me all the way to fort hancock, which was kinda do-or-die considering that i&rsquo;d left the beaten path of other options unless i wanted to ride substantially further, probably past dark, plus we worked out a series of 60-70 mile days based on staying here.</p>
<p>quite a boring ride, once out of trafficklandia.  the only real excitement came when a pack of 3 mid-sized dogs came charging at me in the middle of nowhere (well, they came from a house&rsquo;s yard), and had no trouble pacing me at my top speed.  looked for a good minute like i was gonna get chewed up, until one of them fell off the pack and the others looked back for a moment and then decided the chase was over.  i wish i had Matt Villhauer&rsquo;s dog whispering ability.  i was shouting them off, but he can say a stern &ldquo;NO&rdquo; and dogs just stop.  didn&rsquo;t work for me, or i don&rsquo;t have the magic/mojo anyways.  lucky there was no traffic around while this was happening, since i was all over the road dodging and not paying much attention to my surroundings :/</p>
<p>finally rolled into &ldquo;town&rdquo; which is rumored to have ~2k people, but i saw less than 100 buildings on the only actual street in town, so i question the census on that one.  fortunately, the hotel despite looking shut (0 cars or lights on) was in fact open and i have a room.  hot water&rsquo;s out, but i&rsquo;ll take a cold shower in the morning to wake up, i guess.  it was the perfect temperature today that i honestly didn&rsquo;t sweat very much so i&rsquo;m not feeling gross&hellip;</p>
