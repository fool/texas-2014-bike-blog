                    <p>well, phooey, I suddenly can&rsquo;t get the phone to talk to the computer even after quite a reboot festival (time spent:  all i care to spend) so there may not be any more pictures from the road.  but i&rsquo;ll still tell you stories and there will eventually be pictures&hellip;<br/><br/>today was short but brutal.  started out great, since the RV park i was intending to camp in last night was closed forever, so i got the last room in the only hotel in town, and it was great!  best $50 hotel room i&rsquo;ve ever had, and i&rsquo;ve had several during this trip alone.  the bed was real furniture, the room was actually clean, and the walls were thick enough i never heard my neighbors.  so i woke up pretty well rested, but then didn&rsquo;t want to show up in the town of globe looking to camp at 10am&hellip;so i waited til 10am to head to breakfast and then out of town.  Emily (who did this route last year) warned me about a tunnel coming out of town, and truly it was unpleasant.  mostly because it was on a serious incline and there was no shoulder and it was dark and trafficky in there!  i took the approach at about 5mph, pushing as hard as i could - steep hill is steep - and waited for a lull in traffic, which actually almost worked - i made it halfway through the tunnel before i got passed, and in fact, nobody hit me or even came close (in the tunnel).  the rest of the day featured occasionally disappearing shoulders, frequently when there was a passing lane&ndash;but taking that lane didn&rsquo;t work very well and a couple cars squeezed past when i was relegated to the edge by honks, or just when i was struggling uphill and not going super straight.  in the end, no harm except to my &ldquo;is this actually a good idea?&rdquo; sensibilities.<br/><br/>and there were quite scenic vistas!  blast technofailure, i took some pictures of them, and they are good.  it looks, at times, like i&rsquo;m biking through the grand canyon - same dry red cliff faces in the near, middle, or far distance.  not a lot of man-spoilage, particularly during the parts that are purely under the jurisdiction of the forest service (am riding through the tonto national forest at the moment.  i don&rsquo;t think the lone ranger national forest is on this route&hellip;)<br/><br/>due to many breaks (mostly pulling off the road between guardrails during the shoulderless parts so i could stop worrying for a minute or 10 that the next person was going to fail to move over) finally made it into the miami/globe area around 1, and sat at sonic til 2 drinking my lunch (malt + slushie) and trying to figure out where exactly the RV park was.  finally got enough of a cell connection to google-map it (those pre-cached maps i was worried about back on day 0?  pretty useless - they don&rsquo;t zoom all the way in, so there aren&rsquo;t street names for the most part :/) and found my way on down.  the proprietress was nice enough, and apologetic for the lack of shower or any facilities that weren&rsquo;t a picnic table and a portapotty (but, wifi at least!).  but today being so short i wasn&rsquo;t really filthy, just sweaty, so i took a hose shower and pitched my tent and wrote this.  tomorrow will be a long day, but the aforementioned proprietress knows the route and suggested that though she doesn&rsquo;t ride, people who&rsquo;ve been through have not thought it too terrible, flat as it is.  hopefully i can get up and get rolling right after sunrise and thus make it to my destination in time to camp.<br/><br/>in the meantime, i have a bent fender that is completely preventing the back wheel from moving, that i&rsquo;ll be doing some delicate surgery on.  and i bet there&rsquo;s a restaurant somewhere in town that&rsquo;ll serve me dinner.  so i&rsquo;ve got that going for me :)<br/><br/>hugs from the road!</p>
