The power lines end at Jackson's Hide-A-Way RV park.  It's the literal edge of town; the road ends here.  Not much of a road, really - in the desert, dirt roads are sand roads and I started by pushing through the first 20 feet, then wobbly-pedaling like in the snow down about 1/4mi out of Ocotillo, and as I reached the stop sign at the corner near the RV park, I'm passed by a fellow on a little ATV who admits that my sand-slog "on them skinny tires!" had impressed him, and I laugh, remembering a time when I stashed my panniers to follow Ian S and Scott N down an unmarked road in the Mojave that ended in lava tubes that few people had ever seen...3 years ago, a ways up the road from here but in the same desert.

Ocotillo, and indeed my last 8 miles into town, were dominated by windmills.  there's a massive windfarm installation here, almost 200 propellers.  there's almost nowhere here you can't see them from.  also present is their attempted foil, a "guess that didn't work" call to arms shown on posters plastered over someone's fence about the BLM destroying the desert with their turbines, "enjoy your desert while you can!"  replete with grim reaper graphic.  and i think Edward Abbey might agree with the signs, but i can see the beauty in their forms as well as their function, myself.

interesting that this place generates so much electricity, and uses so little (Ocotillo, CA: population 266, sports no casinos, or indeed, much in the way of nightlife, or daylife - 3 cafes and a gas station), and that the windmills, which all, creepily, blink their red lights in tandem every 30 seconds to warn off planes, push some juice into this out-of-the-way RV park, a full half mile (as the crow flies - as the bike rides, over a mile to avoid the sand slog) from anywhere else "in town"...for me to type this.

settling into a rhythm, maybe?  my butt disagrees and will get the lotion tonight in hopes that it's not quite so on fire tomorrow.  while spandex between my thunderthighs prevents chafing, wet fabric against them for hours straight causes discomfort which outlasts the wearing of the shorts.  fortunately, taking them off and getting dried out helps a lot, and the pain is still more manageable than "normal" chafing, since it's all topical and doesn't manage to break the skin.  perhaps more than you wanted to know, but it's on my mind (and my ass).

today i set out from the campground on the rez, and pedaled uphill about 1500' before i got to a cute small town where i bought a gatorade.  down the road 2 miles, is an even cuter town, which of course i had to stop and patronize somehow?  so i had a brunch malt.  breakfast was canned salmon, port wine cheese, tortillas, and a banana, so the malt felt good and powered me over the next few climbs.  yesterday was 2500', today more like 3000' of climbing, but i'm done until after tomorrow, and then, the climbs go from "sigh" to "manageable!" for the rest of the week.  and i did get the incredible payback of a 12-mile downhill at the end of today, so things pay off, even if you're not Ken or Ed and "in love with the uphills".

let's see, what happened?  some scenic moments, some tawdry things, a new acquaintance, "Carl", who is walking across america!  he walked from philly to abilene, and was pretty snowed under in the texas panhandle winter, so he hitched a ride out to san diego, and is now walking to abilene to complete his trek.  he certianly escaped the winter - the sun here is still brutal, and i guess, the beating down will continue until morale improves?  anyway, he was a genuinely nice soul but there's no way he'll catch up to me - we talked before the 12 mile downhill which i got to coast but he woulda had to walk and while he has 30 mile days sometimes - i don't think he was gonna make 20 miles in the 3 hours between when i pulled up to him and when the sun set.

tawdry - had lunch at a casino with no sense in its name - "the golden acorn" - well, anyway, it was cheap, air conditioned, and nonjudgmental of my thoroughly sweat-stained shirt.  a bunch of trucks driving, carrying more, smaller trucks to somewhere sandy to go play.

amongst the scenic moments depicted when i can next post pictures, probably this afternoon after i make my next outpost:

- tecate divide, the second highest point on my ride today (highest was just above 4000'), is pictured, and in the background is a road sign to "tierra del sol rd".  land of the sun.  but this whole place is that!

- passed thorugh the town of Jacumba, which i asked - it's pronounced mexican style, 'hacumba' - not texan style, which is what i was expecting...  however, this is a lot closer to mexico than the parts of texas that i've frequented.  it was a weird stretch - had a large property that was ringed with bizarrely dressed mannequins and a concrete snail, had a huge metal snake making the county park less than welcoming, and was also the closest to mexico that the route goes.

- so i got you guys a couple pictures of the Silly Wall - the huge fence we've erected between us and mexico...but as you'll notice, it does not in fact go the whole way.  as i biked close to the border, strangely, the border patrol presence didn't really evidence more strongly - reserving their motion to the earlier and later points of the day, when i was more like 30 miles from the border, rather than 100 yards.  Carl said he had been somewhat harassed by border patrol - who walks across the country?  but surmised that biking across the country is "normaller" so maybe i hadn't been as "weird"...dunno if that's true but anyway, i've never been bugged, not even 3 years ago when i rode my bike down the coast to where california, mexico, and the ocean all make out (though there was some hilarity in that there were border patrol agents EVERYWHERE then - black helicopters, atv's, jeeps, and i swear i saw a guy pop up in the middle of a field, look around, and then lay back down.)  today was no different in lack of harassment, though i worried a little more after meeting carl.

- the last-but-one three pictures are (will be) from the epic downhill.  usually nobody loves riding on the shoulder of an interstate highway, but i8 was okay in my book - immaculately clean, super wide shoulder, rumble strip keeping cars or me from drifting, and pretty incredible scenery.  plus losing 3000' without pedaling, proving the rabbit ears stable up to about 35mph (i feathered the brakes at that point, since my head was wobbling a bit in the breeze), well...it's no Box Canyon (i'll have to dig up that video from my last south cali tour when i get home - because that was the best scenic downhill riding i can remember)...but it was freaking great.

so, i ended up at the RV park and was immediately glad i did - first person sitting in front of their RV said "hi and this is a great place for bikers, go talk to the proprietor over there..." so i did and Mr. Jackson is indeed a character - 92 years young, looking way younger, and enjoying his golden years out in the desert.  i have a kitchen, am gonna sleep on a couch, and showered in his personal bathroom, and have been repeatedly treating myself to his "no fucking additives" water straight up from his 3200' well.  he's an opinionated guy, but wouldn't take payment besides "a donation if you feel like it" for sleeping on his couch in his little slice of heaven.  that last picture is (will be) sunset over his slice of heaven as i rode back into town to get dinner at his recommended watering hole, where the local color is out and i got a complement on my "lovely turd cutter" by a guy who's trying that out on everyone in the bar of both genders.  sounds like a keeper to me, though the microwave burrito was good, and the beer was cold...the bar is forgettable (except, 4 good beers and a burrito for $14, what?), but the sunset wasn't.  and hey, the turdcutter complimenter fella *did* just buy the bar a round...of water.</p>
