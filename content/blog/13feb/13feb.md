4:45pm - I'm sitting here, trapped between a beautiful coincidence of sunset and full-moonrise, on Vandenburg air force base getting a view that one cannot otherwise (off of a train) have as a civilian.  Occasional deepening sky color, from azure to crimson, over sudden beaches right, cliff faces left, unexpected SpaceX rocket gantry...with the white face poking between, then over, clifftops as we time traveled.  I've had 3 different seatmates on this trip, and two have been pleasant enough and I slept through the other one.  Time has passed, mostly sedate.  Some gorgeous, some remote, some both.  Ocean, trees, and occasional neighborhoods encamped next to the graffiti-magnet walls that line the track...walls existing mostly only existing where you find graffiti; everywhere else finds fences sufficient.

The train trip is a reverse-repeat of one I made at the end of my last big tour-in-the-desert-in-february, 3 years ago.  I recognized all the train stations until sunset in santa barbara, my southernmost [https://www.amtrak.com](Amtrak) point of travel until now.  This time on the train kind of washes over me.  I'm hypnotized by the landscape with real-time parallax effects, with the sinuous curve of antique power line draped over infinite decaying poles, telling a story of elements and neglect, paced and undermined by signposts warning of buried fiber optic cable which match the old pole-route turn for turn.

I watched the rain of the evening southbound through Eugene to the snow of midnight near Klamath Falls, but then I slipped between the imaginary world sealed outside of my metalliglass box via dream and by once going outside to stand in the rain to breathe some unrecycled air.  Now I watch the wine-dark horizon turn into a dark grey wool blanket against the waves as the night takes over.  Sudden clanks and creaks remind me that we are in motion, and that the parallax effects are due to velocity, along predestined route between fences and trees and waves and (rarely) walls.  Nearly entirely outside city limits.

I suddenly realize how fragile my location sensing capability is, trying to track the train - I have the [purpose-made ACA maps](https://www.adventurecycling.org/cyclosource-store/route-maps/sp/adventure-cycling-association-southern-tier-map-set/) with their infinite relevant detail, but wandering off of their designated route renders them nearly useless with lack of accompanying detail.  Google maps are the best thing since sliced bread, the primary raison d'etre for smartphones in my opinion, but they are only good as a *reference* without ability to phone home - can't route; can't search.  Can only find yourself when the GPS radios finally get a reply, hopefully within a range of content that you have successfully cached, in individual 15-mile-wide slices, along a route that you have carefully and diligently preselected to match the typical intentions of folks following the ACA maps.  Someone like me without a sense of direction or distance will (as always, outside of my minimal known-space orbits) have to pay extra attention to stay on route, keep extra cellphone batteries around, etc.  Don't worry; I think I'm prepared.

*Narrator from the future:  Spoiler - he was, in fact, sufficiently prepared*

9:21 pm: Arrived Los Angeles and am captivated by their glowingly beautiful Union Station.  Very much enjoying sitting outside in a tshirt under the palm trees after dark.  I know it gets colder from here, but at least it&rsquo;s starting from somewhere totally balmy and enjoyable!  The train arrived here a half-hour early after 29 hours in transit;  now I transfer to a different, short, San Diego bound train before I sleep.
