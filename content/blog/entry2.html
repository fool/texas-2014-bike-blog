                                    <h1>yesterday, a diamond in the rough</h1>
                    <p>achievement unlocked!  i scaled the side of that mountain, the first &frac34; of it pretty much without stopping.  there was very little traffic, less than a dozen folks going my way.  it took me around 2.5 hours to go the 13.5 miles and ~2500&rsquo; elevation gain.  unfortunately, it pretty well wore me out - i couldn&rsquo;t hack the 80 miles to the next town, so i stopped around 60 at the only place to stay that was anywhere down the road from the pass, instead of trying to do the last ~25, uphill, during rush hour and racing against darkness.  usually, my legs are the last thing to get tired - it&rsquo;s my ass, hands, arms, shoulders, feet&hellip;but today, the legs were beat after the pass - i found myself coasting a lot where i&rsquo;d normally pedal, and if it hadn&rsquo;t been so downhill i probably would have had to hitchhike on the flats just to get this far!  i did get off and walk for about 5 minutes on the way up the pass - net speed change -1mph from 4.5 to 3.5mph, on the steep near the top.  anyway, i&rsquo;ll roll into silver city early tomorrow, find &ldquo;the bike house&rdquo;, and hopefully get cleaned up - since this is day 2 without a shower.<br/><br/>pretty soon after the 6200&rsquo; pass, i crossed the state border into Nude Mexico.  in celebration of this, i rode the next 20 miles naked (just kidding).  there was only one real obvious change - desert was done (again?) - high plains, here - forest at the top, but as soon as i came down a bit, nothing but sand-colored grass rustling for miles and miles and miles.  of course, out of the unfenced forest and into no-trespassing-marked farmland, so perhaps former forest, but now, just grass (and cows and horses).  the road shoulders were still pretty well cared for, though the road was patched in pretty sloppy style in some places, it was pretty rare.  so i&rsquo;m only missing greenlee county&rsquo;s DoT a little bit, and NMDoT is so far okay in my book :)<br/><br/>save for that closed RV park, all of my surprise unmapped discoveries have been positive:  bonus restaurants and convenience stores where none were marked on the map (the maps i have are very targeted towards this goal of riding through, and just show the services that are relevant, usually - from convenience store to library (for internet access i guess), hotel to campground, plus bike shops and post offices.)  this day is no exception, having a restaurant instead of a convenience store, though i&rsquo;d already eaten so i instead downed a gatorade and a dr pepper, which perked me up most of the way to&hellip;<br/><br/>&hellip;my bed for tonight is as advertised - at the bill evans lake &ldquo;primitive campground&rdquo; - some vault toilets around a lake, and nothing else.  4 miles off the route, but rather less elevation gain, and way less distance than silver city.  it was still up a big hill so i had to promise myself it would be gorgeous all the way up.  and i got there and it was rather pretty - a decent sized lake, clean water, but also, pretty trashed - signs everywhere saying pack it out, and evidence everywhere showing that nobody actually does.  just as i was thinking about how oregon is maybe unique in the states about its preservatory instincts (i see so little trash on the side of the roads, but especially in parks), a one-eyed, three-legged dog bounds up to me and i look for its owner and see jonathan - walking around with a trashbag and a &ldquo;claw&rdquo; (thing to grab things at a distance).  i chat with him a bit and offer to help out so he gives me a fullsize trash bag which i fill in about 30 minutes&hellip;and then wash my hands vigorously. chatted some more with him later (as we were both walking around the lake in different directions) and he turns out to be a really nice guy from silver city, brings his dad up here to fish once a week and always leaves with a few bags of trash.  the state of the place indicates it could really use a few more like him, but after our work, was upgraded from C to B in terms of clean.  the bathrooms need a power wash to get to A-ville, plus, there is still plenty of trash, just less obvious trash now that we got all the fast food wrappers.  we didn&rsquo;t get 1 million cigarette butts, all the broken glass, etc, but still vast improvement!<br/><br/>somewhere in there, i took a brief dip in the chilly lake to rinse off, despite the warning signs about how some kid drowned here in 2008.  i&rsquo;m not sure how he drowned unless it was intentional or alcohol was involved - this lake is totally calm, and while not stagnant (water is pumped in and out for a mining operation 20 miles away, says jonathan), has no waves, and no in/outflow at surface level, and has a nice gradual beach in most locations.  anyway, i still spared a moment at his memorial that i discovered while pseudotrespassing around the lakeside with the pumphouse that advertised &ldquo;no one allowed past here&rdquo;, and i got a chance to use my climbing gym skillz to successfully get up a near-vertical wall where one was clearly not intended to be able to go :)<br/><br/>as i walked around the lake, the sun started to go below the peaks on the horizon, which was sad - the views from the side of the lake were pretty stellar but began to darken soon after i noticed them - into the surrounding hills, which are largely unspoilt (considering i am 30 miles from any concentration of more than a hundred folks).  sunset was glorious, and i watched it several times as i walked away from it, turning to see the sun on the lip of the hills, then walking a bit, turning around, and watching again.  sunsets since i&rsquo;ve left have been incredible - desert sunsets, i now remember, almost always are - so colorful and almost always some wisp of a cloud shows up to help display the color.  tonight, a very enduring unstormy pinkess finished my incredible multisunset, as i sat in my inflatable chair (built from my sleeping mat and a frame sold for the purpose) + drank some whiskey from portland, which are two so-far unused things i&rsquo;ve been toting this whole way!<br/><br/>now, to hope i can stay awake late enough to enjoy the first light-pollution-free, mostly notcloudy night with the stars?  (spoiler:  i did, they were grand!)<br/><br/>i also hope that nobody drives up and decides tonight&rsquo;s a good night for a raging party, since dude and i cleaned up plenty of obvious bonfire + a case of beer remnants.  (turned out that a few people showed up post-sunset - one group even built a fire a hundred yards from me but then left within an hour, failing to put out their fire!), but aside from a couple drive-by&rsquo;s after i was bedded down (headlights, saw my tent, then retreated), it was a calm undisturbed night of much sleep.</p>
