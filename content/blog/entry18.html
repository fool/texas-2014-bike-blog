                                    <h1>wrap up for phase 2 - bike to texas</h1>
                    <p>so i&rsquo;m done riding my bike - after 24 days in the saddle, 1420 miles, and lotsa hours, people, cacti, breezes, and hills, i tossed my bike in a car and drove the rest of the route - there&rsquo;s no bus outta del rio, and the train station won&rsquo;t work (no way to buy a bike box or get my bike loaded - can only take carry on luggage from del rio).  i&rsquo;d riddeninto austin on the route before, for about the last day&rsquo;s worth (johnson city onwards) so i just drove the route up to that point.  there were some beautiful vistas, and some terrifying, blind corner no shoulder cliffside hills (particularly around leakey, tx), that i didn&rsquo;t mind missing.  also, some long days with nothing on &lsquo;em - 90 miles without anything = carrying a lot and camping by the side of the road.  while there was no more border patrol omnipresence, there was plenty of hunting-ranch to go around and it strikes me that camping by one of those is probably not a best practice.  i did see 4 folks riding the other direction, but nobody going east.  a lonely road this time of year, except for David!  who&rsquo;s waiting for me in town, we&rsquo;ll have to go ride lighter bikes around now that we can :)<br/><br/>i rolled in around rush hour, but headed straight to friend gavino&rsquo;s home, since he&rsquo;s west of town and thus west of rush hour traffic.  played some disc golf, caught up with eachothers&rsquo; lives, and had good times in general.<br/><br/>today, my ass is already recovered, legs are getting twitchy, but still feeling like i did the right thing by stopping while i was having fun until waiting til the honeymoon was completely over.  I shipped off 18 pounds of gear this morning, and tossed ~5# of spoiling/used food.  lighter bike is light, even though i&rsquo;m still carrying my sleeping gear for maximal couchsurfing (or sleeping under a bridge&hellip;er&hellip;just kidding?) possibilities.<br/><br/>i sure do miss ya, portland!  but, hello, austin! anxiously awaiting sister&rsquo;s baby which should be here within the next week, then i&rsquo;ll get some family time to go with friend time :)  this afternoon, some drinks with a friend, then tomorrow, hanging out with shay and checking out her sxswparty and then thursday evening writing group.  yeehaw!</p>

<p>PS: i have about 20 pictures to post once i find a slightly better internet connection&hellip;</p>
